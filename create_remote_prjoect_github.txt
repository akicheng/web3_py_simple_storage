I think you make a bare repository on the remote side, 
    %git init --bare 
add the remote side as the push/pull tracker for your local repository 
    %git remote add origin https://github.com/akicheng 
and then locally you just say 
    %git push origin master. 
Now any other repository can pull from the remote repository.
