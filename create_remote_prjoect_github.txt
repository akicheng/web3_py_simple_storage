First
    bowser https://github.com/akicheng
    create New repository Name "my_project" on the github website
    
I think you make a bare repository on the remote side, 
    %git init --bare 
add the remote side as the push/pull tracker for your local repository 
    %git remote add origin https://github.com/akicheng/my_project
    %git add .
    %git commit
and then locally you just say 
    %git push origin master. 
Now any other repository can pull from the remote repository.
